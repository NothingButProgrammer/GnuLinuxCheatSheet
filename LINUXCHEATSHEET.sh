echo "Why would you want to use Linux?
1)Linux is free
2)Linux is open source which means that the everyone can view the code. This makes the system very safe.
3)Linux is customizable. You can make it look and feel different, you can change EVERYTHING. That explains why there are so many verisions of linux -
they are called dstributions."

echo "There are 3 main distros (distributions) on which everything is based on: debian, arch, redhat.
There are different packages for all of those systems. Packages are programs for your system.
linux mint - easy to use!
ubuntu - the most popular one, but a bit harder than linux mint, you may need the knowlage of terminal
debian - not easy to use, but very interesting!
pop_os - linux for gamers, easy to use!
manjaro linux - arch based, not very easy to use, must know terminal.
elementary os - very nice looking, easy to use"

echo "
also you need to know that systems can have different desktop enviroments - it's just like windows themes.
there are 5 main: xfce - for not very powerful computers, kde - a very great looking one, GNOME - what ubuntu uses, cinnamon - something like xfce,
mate - something like cinnamon and GNOME at the same time. There are also window managers."
#note: I will add the terminal cheat sheet later, this is the 0.0.3 version of the program
#maybe a bit more ASCII arts
